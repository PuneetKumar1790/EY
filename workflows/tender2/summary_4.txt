These criteria are fundamental for determining initial bid eligibility and avoiding disqualification.
    Only manufacturers with works located in India and possessing valid GST registration are eligible to bid.

MSME units registered under Small Scale Industries of Gujarat State are eligible for EMD exemption by submitting notarized copies of one certificate from Group A (Udyam Registration) and one from Group B (CSPO/NSIC/DGS&D), or for lower EMD amounts by submitting one certificate from either group. Bidders from countries sharing a land border with India (China, Pakistan, Bhutan) are eligible only if registered with the Registration Committee constituted by DPIIT, and must upload a notarized "Country Boundary Certificate." Firms that are stop-dealt or banned by GUVNL or its subsidiaries are also considered stop-dealt or banned for PGVCL.
