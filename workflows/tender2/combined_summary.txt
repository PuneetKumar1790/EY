**7. Commercial & Financial Terms**

This section extracts major financial or commercial conditions, including fees, payment schedules, and penalty clauses. This data is essential for accurate pricing, cash flow forecasting, and risk assessment, ensuring all financial implications are understood before bidding.

Tender Fee, EMD, and Performance Security: A non-refundable Tender Fee plus applicable GST is required, payable in cash (up to Rs. 10,000) or via RTGS/NEFT/online. EMD can be paid via RTGS/NEFT/online for all amounts, or by Demand Draft/Banker’s Cheque/Pay Order/Bank Guarantee for amounts exceeding Rs. 3 Lakhs. MSME units registered under Small Scale Industries of Gujarat State with CSPO/NSIC/DGS&D certificates are exempt from EMD. If EMD is a Bank Guarantee, it must be valid for 6 months from bid submission. The document does not explicitly mention a Performance Security amount or requirement.
Payment Terms: Specific payment terms (e.g., "Within 30 days of delivery") are not explicitly stated in the provided text.
Delivery Penalty or LD Clause: A specific delivery penalty or Liquidated Damages (LD) clause is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
Price Variation / Escalation Clause: The "Statutory Variation clause will not be applicable in case of Supplier / Contractor has opted for Composition Scheme under GST." This implies that for suppliers not under the Composition Scheme, a statutory variation clause might be applicable, but the document does not explicitly define whether the price is firm or variable otherwise.
Price Basis: Prices quoted should be "FIRM / VARIABLE" and on an "F.O.R. Destination basis" (i.e., any of the Company's stores in Gujarat). Bidders must provide a break-up of the Total Unit F.O.R. Destination Price in Schedule-B, including Unit Ex-works price, freight, packing & forwarding charges, Insurance Charges, GST, and Cess as applicable.

**8. Evaluation Criteria**

This section summarizes how the tender will be evaluated, covering both technical and financial aspects. Understanding these criteria is critical for strategizing the bid, highlighting strengths, and anticipating how Asian Wires Pvt. Ltd.'s offer will be judged against competitors.

Technical Bid Evaluation Basis: The tender operates on a two-bid system (Techno-commercial Bid and Price Bid). Technical bids will be evaluated for conformity to technical specifications. PGVCL reserves the right to open or not to open the price bid based on the bidders' past performance of supplied materials.
Financial Bid Evaluation Basis: Price Bids of techno-commercially qualified bidders will be opened. All tenders will be evaluated on a "firm Price End Cost with GST and Cess as applicable basis" unless otherwise specified. If the tender includes a "Total Owning Cost (TOC) Clause," evaluation will be done accordingly, requiring a detailed breakup of the End Cost.
Preference Clauses: No general price preference is given on any account. However, specific quantity distribution preferences apply:
    *   Gujarat-based parties may receive not less than 50% of the quantity if they match the L-1 price and their quoted price is not more than 15% higher than L-1.
    *   Gujarat-based Micro, Cottage, and Small Scale Industrial Units can receive quantity allocation even if their rate is up to 10% higher than other units (11% for women-owned units), provided they match the L-1 price. A quality-based price preference of up to 5% higher is also available for ISI/BIS/Agmark materials if not mandatory. The total price preference for these units will not exceed 15%.
Weightage or Scoring Mechanism: The document outlines quantity distribution rules based on supplier categories (New-1, New-2, Regular) and item criticality. For critical items, New-1 suppliers are restricted to 10% of quantity, New-2 to 25%, with total new suppliers limited to 50%. For Cables, Conductors, and Conveyor Belts, New Suppliers are allotted up to 10% (New-1) / 25% (New-2) of Tender Quantity or Minimum Drum Length, whichever is higher. For non-critical items, New-1 suppliers are restricted to 30%, and New-2 to 40%. L-1 regular parties will receive heavy weightage in order placement. The company may relax these conditions if regular supplier rates are too high or quantities are insufficient. Negotiation with L-1 New and lowest Regular categories is possible if there is a lack of serious competition.

**9. Contacts and Clarifications**

5.  **Eligibility and Registration Requirements**
    This section summarizes all mandatory conditions a vendor must meet to be considered for the tender, impacting whether a bid can even be submitted. It covers requirements like manufacturer status, specific registrations, certifications (e.g., BIS, ISO), past experience, and financial thresholds. These criteria are fundamental for determining initial bid eligibility and avoiding disqualification.
    Only manufacturers with works located in India and possessing valid GST registration are eligible to bid. A crucial requirement is a valid vendor registration with GUVNL or any of its subsidiary companies (GSECL / GETCO / DGVCL / MGVCL / UGVCL / PGVCL) prior to the technical bid opening date. Bidders must submit a self-certified copy of their valid Factory License, and a self-certified copy of a valid ISO Certificate if applicable. A notarized copy of a valid BIS License for the tendered item is mandatory, with provisional certificates not being accepted. Bidders who have applied for new/renewal of a BIS license before the tender opening can participate by submitting proof of application, but must provide the notarized BIS license within 45 days of LOA issuance. MSME units registered under Small Scale Industries of Gujarat State are eligible for EMD exemption by submitting notarized copies of one certificate from Group A (Udyam Registration) and one from Group B (CSPO/NSIC/DGS&D), or for lower EMD amounts by submitting one certificate from either group. Bidders from countries sharing a land border with India (China, Pakistan, Bhutan) are eligible only if registered with the Registration Committee constituted by DPIIT, and must upload a notarized "Country Boundary Certificate." Firms that are stop-dealt or banned by GUVNL or its subsidiaries are also considered stop-dealt or banned for PGVCL.

6.  **Technical Specifications (Core Product Data)**
    This section captures the precise technical characteristics and standards required for each product, directly influencing product design and manufacturing. It includes parameters such as cable type, core configuration, material, and applicable standards, even if inferred from other sections like price variation. This detailed data is indispensable for accurate product matching, ensuring compliance, and preparing a technically sound offer.
    The tender requires LT Aerial Bunched Cables conforming to Indian standard specifications and bearing ISI marking. While detailed technical specification tables are referenced in Part III of the tender documents, the provided text includes specific cable configurations and their associated material variation factors for price adjustment. These include: 1C x 35 sqmm + 1C x 16 sqmm + 25 sqmm, 2C x 50 sqmm + 1C x 25 sqmm + 35 sqmm (not in BOQ, but in PV table), 3C x 35 sqmm + 1C x 16 sqmm + 25 sqmm, and 3C x 50 sqmm + 1C x 25 sqmm + 35 sqmm.

For example, the 3C x 50 sqmm + 1C x 25 sqmm + 35 sqmm cable has Aluminium phase conductor variation factor (Alph) of 0.411 MT/KM and XLPE phase conductor variation factor (CCFAlPh) of 0.141 MT/KM.

7.  **Commercial & Financial Terms**
    This section outlines the monetary and contractual conditions governing the tender, directly impacting pricing strategies and financial risk assessment. It covers fees, security deposits, payment schedules, potential penalties, and whether prices are firm or subject to variation.

A Performance Guarantee (Security Deposit) towards the execution period must be submitted within 15 days from the date of the Letter of Acceptance. The tender is on a Price Variation Basis, meaning prices are variable, not firm. A detailed formula is provided for price adjustments based on LME Aluminium average settlement prices (including ingot premium) and XLPE Compound prices, with raw material prices being exclusive of GST and other taxes, and based on the 1st working day of the month. Penalties for delayed delivery beyond the schedule delivery date will be applicable as per the Purchase Order terms. GST rates must be clearly mentioned in the online price bid.

8.  **Evaluation Criteria**
