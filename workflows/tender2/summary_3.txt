MSME benefits also extend to quantity allocation and price preference as detailed in the evaluation criteria.

**6. Technical Specifications (Core Product Data)**

This section summarizes every distinct technical specification from the tender's technical sections. Providing a compact list of parameters for each product variation is critical for SKU mapping, ensuring product compliance, and identifying any deviations that might require clarification or alternative product offerings.

The document states that "All technical specification should be ISS/ISI/BIS" and that "Specification framed out by PGVCL shall be separately brought out in the tender documents." It explicitly states that "No deviation in specification shall be allowed and PGVCL decision shall be final." While the document refers to "Technical Specifications etc." and "Techno – Commercial Bid," the actual technical parameters such as Cable_Type, Core_Configuration, Insulation_Type, Rated_Voltage, Applicable_Standards (IS/IEC numbers), Conductor_Material, Insulation_Thickness_min_mm, No_of_Strands, Max_DC_Resistance_Ohm_km, Tensile_Strength_min_N_mm², or Messenger_Composition are not detailed within this provided text. These would be found in a separate "Technical Specifications" document.

**7. Commercial & Financial Terms**

This section extracts major financial or commercial conditions, including fees, payment schedules, and penalty clauses. This data is essential for accurate pricing, cash flow forecasting, and risk assessment, ensuring all financial implications are understood before bidding.

Tender Fee, EMD, and Performance Security: A non-refundable Tender Fee plus applicable GST is required, payable in cash (up to Rs. 10,000) or via RTGS/NEFT/online. EMD can be paid via RTGS/NEFT/online for all amounts, or by Demand Draft/Banker’s Cheque/Pay Order/Bank Guarantee for amounts exceeding Rs. 3 Lakhs. MSME units registered under Small Scale Industries of Gujarat State with CSPO/NSIC/DGS&D certificates are exempt from EMD. If EMD is a Bank Guarantee, it must be valid for 6 months from bid submission. The document does not explicitly mention a Performance Security amount or requirement.

Delivery Penalty or LD Clause: A specific delivery penalty or Liquidated Damages (LD) clause is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
Price Variation / Escalation Clause: The "Statutory Variation clause will not be applicable in case of Supplier / Contractor has opted for Composition Scheme under GST." This implies that for suppliers not under the Composition Scheme, a statutory variation clause might be applicable, but the document does not explicitly define whether the price is firm or variable otherwise.
Price Basis: Prices quoted should be "FIRM / VARIABLE" and on an "F.O.R. Destination basis" (i.e., any of the Company's stores in Gujarat). Bidders must provide a break-up of the Total Unit F.O.R. Destination Price in Schedule-B, including Unit Ex-works price, freight, packing & forwarding charges, Insurance Charges, GST, and Cess as applicable.

**8. Evaluation Criteria**

This section summarizes how the tender will be evaluated, covering both technical and financial aspects. Understanding these criteria is critical for strategizing the bid, highlighting strengths, and anticipating how Asian Wires Pvt. Ltd.'s offer will be judged against competitors.

Technical Bid Evaluation Basis: The tender operates on a two-bid system (Techno-commercial Bid and Price Bid). Technical bids will be evaluated for conformity to technical specifications. PGVCL reserves the right to open or not to open the price bid based on the bidders' past performance of supplied materials.
Financial Bid Evaluation Basis: Price Bids of techno-commercially qualified bidders will be opened. All tenders will be evaluated on a "firm Price End Cost with GST and Cess as applicable basis" unless otherwise specified. If the tender includes a "Total Owning Cost (TOC) Clause," evaluation will be done accordingly, requiring a detailed breakup of the End Cost.
Preference Clauses: No general price preference is given on any account. However, specific quantity distribution preferences apply:
    *   Gujarat-based parties may receive not less than 50% of the quantity if they match the L-1 price and their quoted price is not more than 15% higher than L-1.
    *   Gujarat-based Micro, Cottage, and Small Scale Industrial Units can receive quantity allocation even if their rate is up to 10% higher than other units (11% for women-owned units), provided they match the L-1 price. A quality-based price preference of up to 5% higher is also available for ISI/BIS/Agmark materials if not mandatory. The total price preference for these units will not exceed 15%.
Weightage or Scoring Mechanism: The document outlines quantity distribution rules based on supplier categories (New-1, New-2, Regular) and item criticality. For critical items, New-1 suppliers are restricted to 10% of quantity, New-2 to 25%, with total new suppliers limited to 50%. For Cables, Conductors, and Conveyor Belts, New Suppliers are allotted up to 10% (New-1) / 25% (New-2) of Tender Quantity or Minimum Drum Length, whichever is higher. For non-critical items, New-1 suppliers are restricted to 30%, and New-2 to 40%. L-1 regular parties will receive heavy weightage in order placement. The company may relax these conditions if regular supplier rates are too high or quantities are insufficient. Negotiation with L-1 New and lowest Regular categories is possible if there is a lack of serious competition.
