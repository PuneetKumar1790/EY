### 7. Commercial & Financial Terms

This section extracts major financial or commercial conditions, which are critical for pricing and risk assessment. A non-refundable Tender Fee plus applicable GST is required, payable in cash (up to Rs. 10,000) or via RTGS/NEFT/online. Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) can be paid via RTGS/NEFT/online for all amounts, or by Demand Draft/Banker’s Cheque/Pay Order/Bank Guarantee for amounts exceeding Rs. 3 Lakhs. MSME units registered under Small Scale Industries of Gujarat State with CSPO / NSIC / DGS&D certificates are eligible for exemption from EMD. If EMD is a Bank Guarantee, it must be valid for 6 months from bid submission. The document does not explicitly mention a Performance Security amount or requirement. Specific Payment Terms, such as the duration for payment after delivery, are not explicitly stated in the provided text. Details regarding any Delivery Penalty or Liquidated Damages (LD) Clause for delays are also not included. The Price Variation / Escalation Clause states that the "Statutory Variation clause will be applicable for Aluminium & XLPE material only as per IEEMA price circular." However, this clause "will not be applicable in case of Supplier / Contractor has opted for Composition Scheme under GST." This implies that for suppliers not under the Composition Scheme, price variation for Aluminium and XLPE materials based on IEEMA circulars may apply. The Price Basis requires prices quoted to be "FIRM / VARIABLE" and on an "F.O.R. Destination basis," meaning delivery to any of the Company's stores in Gujarat. Bidders must provide a break-up of the Total Unit F.O.R. Destination Price in Schedule-B, including Unit Ex-works price, freight, packing & forwarding charges, Insurance Charges, GST, and Cess as applicable.

### 8. Evaluation Criteria

This section summarizes how the tender will be evaluated, providing insight into the selection process. The Technical Bid Evaluation Basis states that the tender operates on a two-bid system (Techno-commercial Bid and Price Bid). Technical bids will be evaluated for strict conformity to the detailed technical specifications outlined, the submission of a valid ISI License (where applicable), a duly filled Guaranteed Technical Particulars (GTP) form, and valid Type Test Certificates from a Government of India approved laboratory. Offers will be liable to be ignored or rejected without these mandatory submissions. PGVCL reserves the right to open or not to open the price bid based on the bidders' past performance of supplied materials. The Financial Bid Evaluation Basis dictates that Price Bids of techno-commercially qualified bidders will be opened. All tenders will be evaluated on a "firm Price End Cost with GST and Cess as applicable basis" unless a "Total Owning Cost (TOC) Clause" is specified, which would require a detailed breakup of the End Cost. No general price preference is given on any account. However, specific Preference Clauses for quantity distribution apply: Gujarat-based parties may receive not less than 50% of the quantity if they match the L-1 price and their quoted price is not more than 15% higher than L-1. Gujarat-based Micro, Cottage, and Small Scale Industrial Units registered with CSPO / NSIC / DGS&D can receive quantity allocation even if their rate is up to 10% higher than other units (11% for women-owned units), provided they match the L-1 price. A quality-based price preference of up to 5% higher is also available for ISI/BIS/Agmark materials if not mandatory. The total price preference for these units will not exceed 15%. The Weightage or Scoring Mechanism outlines quantity distribution rules based on supplier categories (New-1, New-2, Regular) and item criticality. For critical items like AB Cables, New-1 suppliers are restricted to 10% of the tender quantity, and New-2 to 25%, with total new suppliers limited to 50%. For Cables, Conductors, and Conveyor Belts, New Suppliers are allotted up to 10% (New-1) / 25% (New-2) of the Tender Quantity or Minimum Drum Length, whichever is higher. L-1 regular parties will receive heavy weightage in order placement. The company may relax these conditions if regular supplier rates are too high or quantities are insufficient. Negotiation with L-1 New and lowest Regular categories is possible if there is a lack of serious competition.
