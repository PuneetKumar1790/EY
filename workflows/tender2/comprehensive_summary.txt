### 8. Evaluation Criteria

This section summarizes how the tender will be evaluated, guiding the bidding strategy. The Technical Bid Evaluation Basis clarifies the criteria for technical acceptance. The Financial Bid Evaluation Basis explains how the lowest bidder (L1) will be determined. Preference Clauses highlight any special considerations (e.g., for MSMEs or local suppliers), and any Weightage or Scoring Mechanism details quantitative evaluation methods.

Technical Bid Evaluation Basis: Bids are submitted in a two-bid system (Techno-commercial Bid and Price Bid). The technical scrutiny committee of PGVCL evaluates the techno-commercial view based on conformity to detailed technical specifications, mandatory submission of a valid ISI License for IS:14255/1995 (where applicable), a duly filled Guaranteed Technical Particulars (GTP) form, and Type Test Certificates from a Govt. of India approved laboratory (not more than five or seven years old). Offers lacking these documents are liable to be ignored or rejected. PGVCL reserves the right to open or not to open the price bid based on past performance of supplied materials. Financial Bid Evaluation Basis: Tenders will be evaluated on a "firm Price End Cost with GST and Cess as applicable basis," unless Total Owning Cost (TOC) is specified. L-1 will be determined based on this end cost. Negotiation and price matching may occur with L-1 New and lowest Regular Categories if there is a lack of serious competition. Preference Clauses include a reservation of not less than 50% of the quantity for Gujarat-based manufacturing units if they match the L-1 price and their quoted price is not more than 15% higher than L-1. MSME units of Gujarat state may receive quantity allocation if they quote up to 10% higher than other units, with women-owned units considered if they quote up to 11% higher. A quality-based price preference of up to 5% higher is applicable for ISI/BIS/Agmark certified materials if not mandatory by law. The total price preference cannot exceed 15%. Weightage or Scoring Mechanism: L-1 regular parties will receive heavy weightage in order placement. Quantity distribution to New-1 Suppliers is restricted to 10% (30% for non-critical items), and New-2 Suppliers to 25% (40% for non-critical items), provided they match the L-1 price of the New Supplier category. For Cables, New Suppliers (New-1/New-2) are allotted up to 10%/25% of the tender quantity or minimum drum length, whichever is higher.
