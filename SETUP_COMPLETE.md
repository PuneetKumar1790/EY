# ✅ Setup Complete!

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **Package Installation Error** - Updated `groq-sdk` to correct version (0.9.0)
2. ✅ **API Key Rotation** - Implemented automatic rotation between 2 Groq API keys
3. ✅ **Dependencies Installed** - Successfully installed all packages

## Current Status

- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ API key rotation implemented
- ✅ Server ready to start

## What You Need to Do Now

### 1. Create Environment File

**Option A - Copy Template:**
```bash
cp env.template .env
```

**Option B - Create Manually:**
Create a `.env` file in the root with:

```env
PORT=3000
GROQ_API_KEY_1=your_first_groq_api_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY_2=your_second_groq_api_key_here
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
EMAIL_TO=puneetk49081@gmail.com
```

### 2. Get Your Credentials

**Groq API Keys (Recommended: 2 keys)**
1. Visit https://console.groq.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create 2 API keys
5. Add them to `.env` as `GROQ_API_KEY_1` and `GROQ_API_KEY_2`

**Gmail App Password**
1. Go to Google Account → Security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification (if not enabled)
3. Go to App passwords
4. Generate password for "Mail"
5. Use this password in `.env` for `EMAIL_PASS`

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
✓ Ensured directory: uploads/tender1
✓ Ensured directory: uploads/tender2
...
✅ Groq client initialized with 2 API key(s)
🔄 API key rotation: Every 50 requests
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Test the API

**Health Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

**Or test in Postman:**
1. Import `postman_collection.json`
2. Test the `/health` endpoint first
3. Then follow the workflow to test all endpoints

## API Key Rotation Details

The system now supports:

- **Automatic rotation** every 50 requests
- **Automatic failover** on rate limit errors
- **Automatic retry** on authentication errors
- **Dual key support** for better performance

You'll see rotation logs like:
```
🔄 Rotating to API key 2/2 (Request #51)
```

## Important Notes

1. **One or Two Keys**: You can use just one API key (`GROQ_API_KEY_1`), but two provides better rate limit handling
2. **Rotation**: The system rotates keys every 50 requests automatically
3. **Errors**: On rate limit errors, it automatically switches to the next key
4. **Logging**: All rotation events are logged to console

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Dependencies installed
2. 📝 Create `.env` file with your credentials
3. 🚀 Start server with `npm start`
4. 🧪 Test with Postman collection
5. 📧 Upload your tender PDFs and test the full workflow
